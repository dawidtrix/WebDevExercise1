                <h2>VFX: Cherry blossom tree</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This VFX is representing the crown/s of cherry blossom tree. In this video there are 3 VFXs, each on
                    a different branch with different size and amount of particles. Additional effect supplementing this
                    VFX is an effect of falling leaves. However, apart from the cherry blossom effect itself there is
                    also a VFX for grass. It uses simple noise patern to locate particles and particle strips to
                    visualize them as individual blades of grass.</p>

                <h2>VFX: Epic LBS guy</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This VFX is representing the might of allmighty LBS guy. This brave warrior accompanied me during the
                    developement of platformer game in 2022/2023. Here I presented him with a King's Cape and legendary
                    Sword of Light. Both in the back and foreground you may notice a third VFX which is just a bunch of
                    falling petals of roses.</p>

                <h2>VFX: Soul Engine</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This VFX has been born from the boredom. The main point was to create multiple "entities" supposievly
                    moving at random directions but at the same time not leaving the scene. This effect was acomplished
                    thanks to the derivative function of a commonly used Perlin Noise. Apart from flying entites, a
                    small particles in the background as well as lightning flare can be notice in the background.</p>

                <h2>VFX: Holy voxel spears + Animation</h2>
                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>This initialy started as a simple test animation. I wanted to check if imported voxel model of the
                    knight had properly set pivot point. After some testing and reimporting, I managed to create this
                    simple animation. Afterwards I supplemented it with a very simple VFX made with voxel spears.</p>
