            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>This VFX is representing the crown/s of cherry blossom tree. <br>In this video there are 3 VFXs, each on a different branch with different size and amount of particles. <br>Additional effect supplementing this VFX is an effect of falling leaves. <br> However, apart from the cherry blossom effect itself there is also a VFX for grass. <br>It uses simple noise patern to locate particles and particle strips to visualize them as individual blades of grass.</p>

            <h2>VFX: Soul Engine</h2>
            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>This VFX has been born from the boredom. <br>The main point was to create multiple "entities" supposievly moving at random directions but at the same time not leaving the scene. <br> This effect was acomplished thanks to the derivative function of a commonly used Perlin Noise. <br> Apart from flying entites, a small particles in the background as well as lightning flare can be notice in the background.</p>

        <h2>VFX: Holy voxel spears + Animation</h2>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>This initialy started as a simple test animation. <br>I wanted to check if imported voxel model of the knight had properly set pivot point. <br>After some testing and reimporting, I managed to create this simple animation. <br> Afterwards I supplemented it with a very simple VFX made with voxel spears.</p>
